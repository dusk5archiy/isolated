# Notice about Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git    # This is for deployment
git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git        # This is for development
```

- Do not use multiple profiles to edit a single repo folder.

- If you want to use multiple profiles, clone the project (in development way) into
multiple folders, each of which is for one profile.
